                <p>We know your compliance anxiety is real</p>

                <p>Changing labor laws and pending state audits, you need a fix for that</p>

                <p>Initially we thought Big giants like ADP and Gusto are behind AI and automations but guess what, The
                    best they could do on their 90's build was to slap some chatbots which can only help you register
                    your query for the paycheckâ€” but can't actually prevent violations yet</p>

                <p>Everything is moving fast</p>

                <p>Why not you???</p>

                <p>In Nozel we tend to automate and back you with our most efficient AI compliance engine which actually
                    got an engine running behind to understand your payroll and your team's compliance risks better.</p>

                <p>We're looking for HR managers to give this a shot.</p>

                <p>We didn't build Nozel because we wanted another compliance tool.<br>
                    We built it because we wanted to back the Human Resource Management with the most effective AI
                    prevention and automation possible.</p>
